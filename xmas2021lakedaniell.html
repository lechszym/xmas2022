							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 1</h3>

							<p>We took our time in the morning for this tramp, as we wanted to get word from the Pakburgs, who were 200km away and were supposed to walk out that day out of <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/kahurangi-national-park">Kahurangi National Park</a> and join us on this tramp.  We could only get a phone signal at Springs Junction, and so we waited there, in the car, hiding from sandflies.  We passed the time sipping flat whites and sucking on juice.  At around 11 am we received a message - they just walked out and were jumping into the car to drive to Lewis Pass.</p>
	
							<p>We drove to the start of the <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/west-coast/places/lewis-pass-scenic-reserve/things-to-do/tracks/lake-daniell-track/">Lake Daniell</a> track.  The plan for us was not to wait, but mosey on slowly, letting the Pakburgs either catch up or meet us at the hut.  The kids were very excited at the prospect of seeing their cousins soon.  We wolfed down our lunch by the car.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0117.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>One more photo at the carpark and we were off.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0119.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>It was cloudy and somewhat cool, with occasional drizzle.  The path, de-marked from all the surrounding greenery by a carpet of tiny brown leaves, veered through a beautiful beech forest.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0125.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Had to take a photo at this funky looking tree branch.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0126.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The conversation centred mostly around Einstein and the theory of relativity.  Not sure how we arrived at this challenging topic, but it was fun to stretch our brains in step with our legs.  It also helped to take the kids minds off the Pakburgs, otherwise there was glancing backwards in anticipation every 20s.  Just past the half way point we found a bench where we had a longer rest.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0139-41.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>On we kept walking.  Had to take a photo of this giant hollow log.  Julian wasn't super keen on climbing inside, but he did it for the sake of the photograph.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0157-9.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
								
							<p>After reaching the <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/west-coast/places/lewis-pass-scenic-reserve/things-to-do/huts/kohanga-atawhai-manson-nicholls-hut/">Kōhanga Atawhai – Manson Nicholls Hut</a>, we settled into our room - there was an 8-bunk one, perfect for our soon to be extended party. Kasia made dinner promptly, for we were starving. The hut itself was brand new - built in 2020, large (sleeping up to 20), roomy, with fancy conveyor belt toilets.  Situated in a lovely spot, it was separated from Lake Daniell by a largish lawn.  Access to the lake was supplemented with a narrow pier jutting out into the water.  The only spoiler, as always, were the sandflies.</p>
							
							<p>The Pakburgs arrived not too long after.  They had a long day - completing one tramp, driving for a few hours, and then starting another.  The greeting scene must have been one for the cameras...but alas we were too busy with hugs and hellos to take pictures.  They made their dinner and we spent the rest of the evening catching up, chatting and drinking tea. The kids played outside with kids from another large tramping party who were also spending the night in the hut.</p>
							
							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 2</h3>
							
							<p>We were going to stay in the same hut for another night.  We settled into our day of relaxing, reading, playing games (cricket, mattress jumping, Azul...etc.) and a bit of exploring.  It was still mostly cloudy, and not super warm, but the kids nevertheless took a dip (twice, I think) in the lake.  A track around the lake provided a mini excursion for those (well just the one, really) who couldn't sit still.  There was nothing to do on the other side, but to take a self-portrait photo.</p>
							
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0205.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
							
							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 3</h3>
							
							<p>We packed everything in the late morning and got ready to walk out, the same way we came.  Just before setting off, we took a few group shots by the pier.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/Megs/IMG_20211223_104508.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
							<span class="featured-caption">Photo courtesy of Meghann Grawburg</span>
													
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0208-9.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
							
							<p>Then we walked back.  We passed the hollow log, and soon got to the half-way bench.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/Megs/IMG_20211223_123108.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
							<span class="featured-caption">Photo courtesy of Meghann Grawburg</span>
							
							<p>We also stopped by the stream, where Meghann took a dip - it looked refreshing, but super cold.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0238.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
							
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0240.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Someone noticed the neat colour scheme between Finn and Julian, who happened to have the same make of backpack: blue bag/orange top vs. orange bag/blue top.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/02_LakeDaniell/IMG_0266.JPG" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							
							<p>Of course, we couldn't pass the funky looking branch without taking more photos.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/Megs/IMG_20211223_142834.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
							<span class="featured-caption">Photo courtesy of Meghann Grawburg</span>
							

							<p>And then we were out, relatively early, leaving us plenty of time to drive to St. Arnaud where we were going to spend the night before our next tramp.  Just one more photo on the concrete block laid across a fault (for measuring movement of tectonic plates, which apparently have not moved since the 60's) and we were done with this lovely tramp.</p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Tramp info</h3>
												
							<p>The Lake Daniell route is flat in most places, with some gentle hills that overall add up to about 150m of rise from the car park to the Kowhanga Atawhai - Manson Nichols Hut.  The distance one way is 7.6km, all through a beautiful beech forest, with walking time of around 3h.</p>
