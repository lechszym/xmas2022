							<p>We waved goodby to the Pakburgs taking the ferry to Wellington on the 29th.  Afterwards we lazied about Picton, visiting the waterfront playground numerous times and eating loads of ice cream.  Then it was time for our last, just the Szymanskis, planned tramp of the summer.</p>


							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 1 (New Year's Eve)</h3>
							
							<p>After checking out of our motel, finding long term parking in town was a nightmare.   But we eventually managed (somehow) and left Picton at 10 am on a boat destined for <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/marlborough/places/queen-charlotte-sound-totaranui-area/historic-ship-cove/">Ship Cove</a>, James Cook's favourite spot in New Zealand, which now is the start of the Queen Charlotte Track (that traverses the Queen Charlotte/T≈çtaranui sound).  

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20211231_101749.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We got off the boat with just our day packs; our heavy pack with tent and sleeping bags would get dropped off at our camp site.  We have booked a luggage ferrying service from campsite to campsite for this whole trip.</p> 

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20211231_110147.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>It took us 1h to get to Ship Cove, and so we had an early lunch there.  Then we set off for the walk over to Resolution Bay, the next bay over, where we were to camp tonight.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20211231_120204-06.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The track was wide and not too steep, though not as even as we expected, for lose rocks were scattered everywhere.  As if no one bothered to clean up after the digger that made the track (we assumed about the digger from the marks on the side).  The flora however was spectacular - tropical and very different to the beech forest of <a href="xmas2021lakedaniell.html">Lake Daniell track</a>.  And the constant noise of cycadas was almost deafening.  We got used to it eventually, for it was to be with us for the entirety of the trip.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20211231_131959.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We reached Resolution Bay Cabins in the afternoon, where the bags were waiting for us at the pier and a camping spot was waiting for us.  After pitching the tent we went for a dip in the ocean.  We celebrated New Year's Eve with a dinner of pasta, dessert of pavlova and a non-alcoholic sparkly drink...that turned out to be Coconut Water (Kasia's bad) that was neither sparkly nor tasty.  But we were too tired to wait for midnight, and eded up (all of us) going to bed rather early.</p>  

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 2 (New Year's Day)</h3>

							<p>The first act of Julian and Iza in the New Year was a swim in the cold waters of Resolution Bay.  Actually, the first act was probably the morning run to the toilet, but we won't count that.  And then there was packing of the tent...but never mind - the important act was the swim.</p>
							
							<p>The sound seems to be devoid of sand and so it's rocky beaches everywhere.  Iza just ended up wading in the water in her sandals.</p>
							
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_091826.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							
							<p>Then we took our time so the kids could dry up a bit.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_093233.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p> We left the heavy bags on the pier (to be picked up by the boat later on), and began our trek to next bay over.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_120644.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The track was very similar to the previous day's - and we still couldn't get enough of the luscious greenery all around us.  Cycadas didn't let up either.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_121822.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>After few hours we reached Furneaux Lodge situated in the Endeavour Inlet.  Our bags were waiting for us there, but this time we didn't pitch the tent, as we had a room (with four beds) booked.   We dined at the Lodge restaurant - a nice break for Kasia from the single time so far on this trip that she had to make our dinner.  Kids still wanted to go for a swim afterwards.</p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_194800-3.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Then we brushed our teeth and turned in for the night.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_202004.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							
							
							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 3</h3>


							<p>Quick breakfast on the lodge grounds, before getting our big bags ready for the boat pick up.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_080254.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Then we set off for our trek around the Endeavour Inlet.  Though the track never steers too far from the water, it's not close to it either.  At one point, when we feel it's time for lunch, we step of the path and brave the bit of bush to get to the water.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_122221-35.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_122822-26.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>It's a hot day, and our pace is slow (for there is no rush without the heavy backpacks on).  </p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_125934.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We eventually reach the Camp Bay Campsite.  The bags are waiting for us at the nearby Punga Resort, so we fetch them with Julian.  Once our tent is up, kids go for a swim.  Later we stroll onto the pier by the campsite, where we spot a ray in the water.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_184738.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The pier is a nice place for a family photo...</p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_184832.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Oh right, we want the whole family.  Ok, let's try that again as a family selfie...</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_184852.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 4</h3>

							<p>Here's Iza in front of our tent in the morning.  The bags are almost packed and ready to go.  We're happy for Iza to still have her sandals, for there was a steal attempt of one by a cheeky Weka the evening before.  Thanks to Julian's quick reflexes (and not dad's clumsy tripping over the tent wire) the sandal was recovered before the bird disappeared in the bush.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220103_074251.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We walk the 5min towards the Punga Resort, where the boat is supposed to pick us up in couple of hours.  Julian has a go at kayaking (photo at the top of the page) and Kasia can't resist the charms of the P≈çhutukawa in bloom.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220103_094908(0).jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>A cargo boat took our big bags already and we need to wait for the passenger boat.  It's late, so we kill time in the Punga Resort restaurant playing imaginary cards (which unfortunately were packed into one of the big back packs).</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220103_110241.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>A sleepy boat ride back to the down...and it's all over - we're back in Picton.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220103_142533.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>							
							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Tramp info</h3>
												
							<p>We have completed only about a third of the entire track.  We used <a href="https://www.cougarline.co.nz/">Cougar Lines</a> for our and our luggage transport.  The track itself is easy, though loose rock on the path between Ship Cove and Camp Bay was a bit annoying.  Ship Cove to Resolution Bay Cabins was 6km, Resolution Bay to Furneaux Lodge 10km and Furneaux Lodge to Camp Bay 12km.  Resolution Bay Cabins is a private site, mostly providing cabins (but tent sites as well); it has a nice kitchen, so cooking is a breeze.  Furneaux Lodge provides fancy cabins as well as basic tramper cabins that we had booked.  Camp Bay Campsite was beautiful - just had to watch out for Wekas; nearby Punga Resort and its restaurant provides good food and <em>Heart of Darkness</em> beer...which came highly recommended...and was sampled...and found decent, but not a new favourite (<em>Emerson's</em> forever baby).</p>  
							
							<p>Things to remember for next time: definitely bring water shoes for swimming and wading over the rocky beaches.</p>
