							<p>We waved goodbye to the Pakburgs boarding the ferry to Wellington on the 29th.  Afterwards we lazied about Picton, visiting the waterfront playground numerous times and eating loads of ice cream.  Then it was time for our last, just the Szymanskis, planned tramp of the summer.</p>


							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 1 (New Year's Eve)</h3>
							
							<p>Once we checked out of our motel, locating suitable long term parking in town was a nightmare.   But we eventually managed (somehow) and left Picton at 10am on a boat destined for <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/marlborough/places/queen-charlotte-sound-totaranui-area/historic-ship-cove/">Ship Cove</a>, James Cook's favourite spot in New Zealand and the start of the Queen Charlotte Track that traverses the Queen Charlotte/Tōtaranui sound.  

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20211231_101749.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We got off the boat with just our day packs; our heavy packs with the tent and sleeping bags would get dropped off at our camp site.  We booked a luggage ferrying service from campsite to campsite for this whole trip.</p> 

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20211231_110147.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The boat ride to Ship Cove was 1h, and so it was time for an early lunch.  Then we set off for the next bay over, where we were to set camp for the night.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20211231_120204-06.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The track was wide and not too steep, though not as even as we expected, for loose rocks were scattered everywhere.  As if no one bothered to clean up after the digger which made the track (assuming about the digger from the marks on the side).  The flora however was spectacular - tropical and very different to the beech forest around <a href="xmas2021lakedaniell.html">Lake Daniell</a>.  And the constant noise of cicadas was near deafening.  We got used to it eventually, for it was to be with us for the entirety of the trip.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20211231_131959.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We reached Resolution Bay Cabins, where we had booked a camping spot, in the afternoon.  The bags were waiting for us at the pier.  After pitching the tent we went for a dip in the ocean.  We celebrated New Year's Eve with a dinner of pasta, dessert of pavlova and a non-alcoholic sparkly drink...that turned out to be Coconut Water (Kasia's bad) that was neither sparkly nor tasty.  But we were too tired to wait for midnight, and eded up (all of us) going to bed rather early.</p>  

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 2 (New Year's Day)</h3>

							<p>The first act of Julian and Iza in the New Year was to take a swim in the cold waters of Resolution Bay.  Actually, the first act was probably the morning run to the toilet, but we won't count that.  I think we also might have packed the tent before getting to the shore... but never mind that - the important act was the swim.</p>
							
							<p>The sound (or at least the part we've seen over this entire trip) was completely devoid of sand and so it was rocky beaches everywhere.  Iza ended up wading in the water in her sandals.</p>
							
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_091826.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							
							<p>Then we sat on the pier for a bit so the kids could dry up.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_093233.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p> We left our heavy bags on the pier (to be picked up by the boat later on), and began our trek to next bay over.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_120644.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The track was very similar to the previous day's, and we still couldn't get enough of the luscious greenery all around us.  Cicadas didn't let up either.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_121822.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>After a few hours, we reached Furneaux Lodge, which is situated deep in the fold of the Endeavour Inlet.  Our big bags were there already, but this time we didn't pitch our tent, as we had booked a room at the Lodge (with four beds) for that night.   We dined at the Lodge restaurant.  The kids insisted on a swim afterwards.</p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_194800-3.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Then we brushed our teeth and turned in for the night.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220101_202004.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							
							
							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 3</h3>


							<p>A quick breakfast on the lodge grounds, before getting our big bags squared away for the boat pick up.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_080254.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Then we set off for our trek around the Endeavour Inlet.  Though the track never steered too far from the water, it was not close to it either.  At one point, when we felt lunch-hunger, we stepped off the path and braved the bit of bush to get to the water.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_122221-35.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_122822-26.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>It was a hot day, and our pace was slow (for there was no rush without the heavy backpacks on).  </p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_125934.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We eventually reached the Camp Bay Campsite.  The bags were waiting for us at the nearby Punga Resort, so we fetched them with Julian.  Once our tent was up, we went for a swim.  Later we strolled onto the pier by the campsite, where we spotted a ray in the water.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_184738.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The pier was a nice place for a family photo...</p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_184832.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Oh right, the whole family.  Ok, here's another try as a family selfie...</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220102_184852.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 4</h3>

							<p>Here's Iza in front of our tent in the morning.  The bags are almost packed and ready to go.  We were happy for Iza to still have her sandals, for there was a theft attempt of one of them by a cheeky Weka the evening before.  Thanks to Julian's quick reflexes (and not dad's clumsy tripping over the tent lines) the sandal was recovered before the bird disappeared in the bush.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220103_074251.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We walked the 5min towards the Punga Resort, where the boat was supposed to pick us up in a couple of hours.  Julian had a go at kayaking (photo at the top of the page) and Kasia couldn't resist the charms of the Pōhutukawa in bloom.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220103_094908(0).jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>A cargo boat took our big bags early in the morning, but we had to wait for the passenger boat.  The boat was late (apparently it always is), so we killed time in the Punga Resort restaurant playing imaginary cards (the real ones, unfortunately, were packed into one of the big back packs that by that point was probably already in Picton).</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220103_110241.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>A sleepy boat ride back to town...and it was all over - we were back in Picton.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/05_QueenCharlotteTrack/20220103_142533.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>							
							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Tramp info</h3>
												
							<p>We have completed only about a third of the entire track.  We used <a href="https://www.cougarline.co.nz/">Cougar Lines</a> for transport.  The track itself is easy, though loose rock on the path between Ship Cove and Camp Bay is a bit annoying.  Ship Cove to Resolution Bay Cabins was 6km, Resolution Bay to Furneaux Lodge 10km and Furneaux Lodge to Camp Bay 12km.  Resolution Bay Cabins is a private place, mostly providing cabins (but tent sites as well); it has a nice kitchen, so cooking is a breeze.  Furneaux Lodge provides fancy cabins as well as basic tramper cabins that we had booked.  Camp Bay Campsite was beautiful - just had to watch out for Wekas; nearby Punga Resort and its restaurant provides good food and <em>Heart of Darkness</em> beer...which came highly recommended...and was sampled...and found decent, but not a new favourite (<em>Emerson's</em> forever baby).</p>  
							
							<p>Things to remember for next time: definitely bring water shoes for swimming and wading over the rocky beaches.</p>
