							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 1 (Christmas Eve)</h3>

							<p>Christmas Eve, we started walking the 2.5h walk towards the <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/nelson-lakes-national-park/things-to-do/huts/bushline-hut/">Bushline Hut</a> just after lunch.  Meg fished out Santa hats out of somewhere, which sparkled beautifully in the sun.  Julian is actually in the photo below, right behind Kasia (you can see his two feet poking out behind her).</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211224_123854.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The day was hot so we stopped often in whatever scrap of shade we could find.  Couldn't pass this bench though and the beautiful view of Lake Rotoiti.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211224_145554.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>After reaching the ridge, and relaxing (briefly) in the Relax Hut (visible in the image below), we kept moving.  Iza was very keen on having her backpack...just not necessarily on carrying it.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211224_153152.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We reached the hut in the late afternoon.  We found a jigsaw puzzle there, which occupied the adults for a few hours.  In the meantime, the kids built their own hut nearby.</p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211224_195714.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Given the prospect of a very arduous next day of tramping, we planned for a super early start.  Thankfully, Santa decided to drop off the presents in the evening, otherwise there would be very little time to enjoy them in the morn of the Christmas day.  Mercifully, it was all small stuff - games, sweets and little trinkets.  Kids loved it.  The little plastic frisbees that Finn and Julian got sparked an impromptu game of chaotic ultimate just outside the hut (the only rule was that there were no rules).</p>

							<p>The sun set and it was time for bed - the super early start demanded a super early bed time.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211224_202539-49.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>


							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 2 (Christmas Day)</h3>

							<p>We are awesome.  We got up at 6am and started getting ready.  Just that feat in itself called for a celebration dance performed to the hum of the gas burner heating the water.</p>

								</video>
							</div>
							
							<p>We were all packed, fed and ready to go by 7:36am.  We probably would have started walking by 7:30am if we didn't take the time to take this group shot.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/Megs/SIXmas2021 Nelson Lakes bushline group shot merry xmas Finn Summer Meg Jacek Lech Kasia Iza Julian.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Over 10km to go, the last third over semi-exposed ridge.  The weather was forecast to be good, but at this point it was cold.  We donned multiple layers, beanies (toques) and gloves.  Oh dear, someone neglected to bring her gloves on the tramp.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_075704.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The blue and orange backpacks lead the way.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_075741-5.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>After about 1h of walking, the track started climbing the ridge.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_083459.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Our formation was: Finn, Julian, Summer and Meg up-front, with Kasia, Lech and Iza lagging a bit behind.  Jacek ferried between the two groups taking lots and lots of photos.  Just as a precaution, we tied a belt to Iza's backpack.  She was in great spirits, singing a new song she learned at school just before the summer break.  Oh...and Kasia has gotten hold of some gloves.  I wonder whose they are?</p>
							
							<div style="width: 740px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
								<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1946-1" width="740" height="416" preload="auto" controls="controls">

							<p>By the way, <a href="https://natalieyuleyeoman.bandcamp.com/track/papat-nuku">Papatūānuku</a>, that song Iza was signing, was written by Mrs. Yeoman, a teacher at Julian and Iza's school.  And if you noticed a person waving on top of the hill at the end of that video, that was Finn.</p>						
							
							<p>2.5h into our march, and still the hard part has not even started.  It was high time for a rest and a snack.  Iza never lets an opportunity to ensconce herself in uncle Jacek's lap slip by.</p>
							
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_094741.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
							
							<p>Others, noticing Iza's comfort, decided to seek the warmth of a parent's lap.</p> 
							
							
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_095711.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Soon after we make it to the top and (almost) the half way point of the day's tramp.  Not quite all downhill from that point on.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_100405.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<span class="featured-caption">Photo courtesy of Meghann Grawburg</span>

							<p>We noticed this wool-like (to the touch) moss growing everywhere.  Later on Meghann emailed DOC about it.  It's commonly known as Vegetable Sheep (raoulia eximia) and it is found in alpine areas of the South Island</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_103050.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>3h into the tramp the harder bit began. It wasn't very exposed, but the scree and the rocks made for some challenging sections.  We had to keep our focus. </p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_103518-523.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/Kasias/20211225_122654.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Another rocky mini-peak - no sweat... though someone is holding to the backpack a bit frantically in the photo below, even though there is really nowhere to fall.  But luckily, at that point there was only a bit to go.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_123656.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>And just like that, 6h went by.  But the hardest part was behind us.  Just had to walk down (carefully) towards the <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/nelson-lakes-national-park/things-to-do/huts/angelus-hut/">Angelus Hut</a>.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_134647-52.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We were tired, but also, thanks to the early start, we had beat the rain.  It was an awesome feeling, sitting in the hut, drawing and drinking tea while the weather took a turn for the worse outside.  It's been a great Christmas Day for a tramper's soul.  </p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_153717.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 3 (Boxing Day)</h3>

							<p>The sunrise was stunning.  It would get rainy in the late afternoon once more, but the first half of the day was sunny.  This was our rest day, as we booked a stay of another night in the same hut.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211226_061631-712.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
							
							
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211226_061927-34.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>So we relaxed,...</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211226_084219.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>..and rested,...</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/Kasias/20211226_105633.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>...and took leisurely strolls around the hut.  A good time, not to mention the stunning scenery, to take a snapshot of the Szymanskis.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211226_113629-31.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 4</h3>

							<p>Once again, the forecast called for rain in the afternoon.  We debated taking an alternate, easier route out, but ultimately decided to stick to our original plan - trekking back through the same ridge to the Bushline Hut we visited two night before.  It was another 7:30am walk out of the hut (we got good at this by this point).  Last minute nature calls caused the usually faster Pakburgs to lag behind, so the Szymanskis had an opportunity to take a family selfie...</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_073226.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>...and a "goodbye-beautiful-hut" photo.  That stick, by the way, was Finn's stick, which supported Kasia later on in the journey back along the ridge.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_073328.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The ridge was lost in the clouds, but the visibility was at all times sufficient to spot the next marker on the track.  We moseyed on and eventually the sun showed its face.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_094451.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_094633.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>On the way back, the ridge seemed way more familiar and less intimidating.  After 2.5 hours we pretty much got through all the harder bits.  In the photo below you can see five figures in the distance - it's Jacek, Julian, Summer, Meg and Finn.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_095523-8.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Soon the path straightened and we are out of the most challenging section.  After a total of 4.5h, we found ourselves quite close to the Bushline hut.  And the weather changed, in an instant, from a cool mountain misty morning to a sunny and hot noon.  Iza still had the energy to sing and skip.</p>

							<p>A group shot with the view of Lake Rotoiti from the Drone Ridge (named so for two girls we noticed nearby posing for their drone).  We don't need a drone when we have someone more keen on taking photos than posing for them.</p>

							<p>Back in the good ol' Bushline Hut.  Jacek, once again, inspired a drawing/painting session after taking out his visual diary of the trip.  Recognise the image he was working on?  It's from a place already mentioned in <a href="xmas2021tophouse.html">these pages</a>.</p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 5</h3>

							<p>Finally the rain caught up to us.  We knew from the forecast it was coming (Bushline Hut has line-of-sight towards St. Arnaud and hence a decent phone signal).  And besides, getting a bit wet on the last day of an awesome 5-day tramp seemed like a trifle.  Rain gear on and we were ready to venture out.</p>

							<p>Wet we got, but the thought of chips at Alpine Lodge (the restaurant in St. Arnaud) kept us smiling all throughout.</p>

							<p>And just like that, our trek was over.  At the parking lot Julian and Finn traced our entire journey on the map.</p>

							<p>From the carpark to Bushline Hut is about 3.5km, but it takes 2.5h since there is a bit of going up.  The track from Bushline Hut to Angelus Hut via Robert Ridge is over 10km, the last third of which is rocky and mildly exposed.  It took us 6.5h in possibly the most ideal (not too hot nor cold) weather.  The rise in elevation from the carpark to Angelus Hut is 833m.  And so, the return in each case, from Angelus Hut to Bushline Hut as well as from Bushline Hut to the carpark, was easier and took us less time.</p>
