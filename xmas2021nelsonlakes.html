							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 1 (Christmas Eve)</h3>

							<p>It's Christmas Eve, just after lunch, and we start the 2.5h walk towards the Bushline hut.  Meg fished out santa huts out of somewhere, which sparkle beautifully in the sun.  Julian is actually in this photo, right behind Kasia (you can see his two feet poking out behind her).</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211224_123854.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The day is hot, so we stop often in whatever scrap of the shade we can find.  Can't pass this bench though and the beautiful view of Lake Rotoiti.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211224_145554.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>After reaching the ridge, and relaxing (briefly) in the Relax hut (visible in the image below), we keep moving.  Iza is very keen on having her backpack...just not necessarily on carrying it.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211224_153152.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We reach the hut in the late afternoon.  We find a puzzle there, which occupies the adults for few hours.  In the meantime, kids build their own hut nearby.</p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211224_195714.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Well aware that the next day is going to be super arduous, we plan for a super early start.  Thankfully, Santa decides to drop off the presents this evening, otherwise there would be very little time to enjoy them in the morn of the Christmas day.  Mercifully, it's all small stuff - games, sweets and little trinkets.  Kids love it.  The little plastic frisbees that Finn and Julian soon get used for an impromptu game of chaotic ultimate just outside the hut (the only rule is that there is no rules).</p>

							<p>The the sun sets and its time for bed - the super early start demands a super early bed time.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211224_202539-49.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>


							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 2 (Christmas Day)</h3>

							<p>We are awesome.  We are all packed, fed and ready to go by 7:36 am.  We probably would start walking by 7:30 am if we didn't take time to take this group shot.  Will that 6 min of tardiness come to hunt us later?</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/Megs/SIXmas2021 Nelson Lakes bushline group shot merry xmas Finn Summer Meg Jacek Lech Kasia Iza Julian.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
							<span class="featured-caption">Photo courtesy of Meghann Grawburg</span>
							
							<p>On our way.  Over 10km to go, the last third over semi-exposed ridge.  The weather is supposed to be good, but right now it's cold.  We put on layers, beanies (toques) and gloves.  Oh dear, someone neglected to bring her gloves on the tramp.  </p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_075704.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The blue and orange backpacks lead the way.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_075741-5.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>After about 1h of walking, the track starts climbing the ridge.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_083459.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Our formation is: Finn, Julian, Summer and Meg up-front and Kasia, Lech and Iza lagging a bit behind.  Jacek ferries between two groups taking lots and lots of photos.  Just as a precaution, we tie a belt to Iza's backpack.  She's in a great spirits, singing a new song she learned at school just before the summer break.  Oh...and Kasia has gotten hold of some gloves.  I wonder whose are those?</p>
							<div style="width: 740px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->

							<p>By the way, <a href="https://natalieyuleyeoman.bandcamp.com/track/papat-nuku">Papatūānuku</a>, that song Iza was signing, was written by Mrs. Yeoman, a teacher at Julian and Iza's school.  And if you noticed a person waving on top of the hill at the end of that video, that was Finn.</p>						
							
							<p>2.5h into our march, and still not hard part not even started.  Time for a rest and a snack.  Iza never lets an opportunity to ensconce herself in uncle Jacek's lap slip by.</p>
							
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_094741.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
							
							<p>Others notice Iza's comfort, and more kids seek a warm parent's lap.</p> 
							
							
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_095711.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Soon after we make it to top and (almost) the half way point of the day's tramp.  But it won't be all downhill from here on.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_100405.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<span class="featured-caption">Photo courtesy of Meghann Grawburg</span>

							<p>We notice this wool-like to the touch moss growing everywhere.  Later on Meghann asks a park ranger about it.  It's commonly known as Vegetable Sheep (raoulia eximia) and it is found in alpine areas of the South Island</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_103050.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>3h into the tramp, and the harder bit starts. It's not very exposed, but the scree and the rocks create some challenging sections, so we need to keep our focus. </p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_103518-523.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Another rocky min-peak - no sweat...though someone is holding to the backpack a bit frantically, even though there is really nowhere to fall.  But luckily, there's only a bit to go.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_123656.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>And just like that, 6h went by.  But the hardest part is over.  Just have to walk down (carefully) towards the Angelus hut.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_134647-52.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>We're tired, but also, thanks to the early start, we have beat the rain.  It's an awesome feeling, sitting in the hut, drawing and drinking tea while the weather takes a turn for the worse outside.  It's a great Christmas Day for a tramper's soul.  </p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211225_153717.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 3 (Boxing Day)</h3>

							<p>The sunrise is stunning.  It will get rainy in the late afternoon once more, but the first half of the day will remain stunning.  It's a rest day for us, as we are booked to stay another night in the same hut.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211226_061631-712.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>So we rest and relax,...</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211226_084219.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>...and take leisurely strolls around the hut.  A good time, as well as stunning scenery, to take a snapshot of the Szymanskis.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211226_113629-31.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 4</h3>

							<p>Once again, the forecast calls for rain in the afternoon.  We debate taking out an alternate, easier route out, but ultimately decide to stick to our original plan - trekking back through the same ridge to the Bushline hut we visited on Christmas Eve.  It's another 7:30 am walk out of the hut (we are good at this now).  Last minute nature calls cause the usually faster Pakburgs lag behind, so Szymanskis have an opportunity to take a family selfie...</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_073226.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>...and a "goodbye-beautiful-hut" photo.  That stick by the way, is Finn's stick, which will support Kasia on the journey back through the ridge.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_073328.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The ridge is all in clouds, but the visibility is sufficient to find the next marker.  We mosey on and eventually the sun shows its face.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_094451.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_094633.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>The ridge on the way back is way more familiar and less intimidating.  After 2.5 hours we are almost through it.  In the photo below you can see four figures in the distance - it's Jacek, Julian, Summer, Meg and Finn.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_095523-8.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Soon the path straightens and we are out of the difficult bit.  After the total of 4.5h, we find ourselves quite close to the Bushline hut.  And the weather changes, almost instantly, from cool mountain mist to sunny and hot noon.  Iza still has energy to sing and skip.</p>

							<p>A group shot with the view of Lake Rotoiti from the Drone Ridge (named so for the two girls nearby we noticed posing for the drone).  We don't need a drone when we have someone more keen on taking than posing for photos.</p>

							<p>Back in the good ol' Bushline hut.  Jacek once again inspires a drawing/painting session when he takes out his visual memory diary out.  Recognise the image he is working on - it's from a place already mentioned in these pages.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211227_142755.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Day 5</h3>

							<p>Finally, the rain catches up to us.  We knew, from the forecast (Bushline hut has line of sight towards St. Arnaud and hence phone signal) it was coming.  And besides, we're about to walk out, so getting a bit wet at this stage is a trifle.  Rain gear on and we are read to venture out.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211228_082350.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>Wet we get, but the thought of chips at Alpine Lodge (the restaurant in St. Arnaud) keeps us going.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211228_102131.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>

							<p>And our trek is over.  At the parking lot Julian and Finn trace our entire journey on the map.</p>
							<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2021/04_NelsonLakes/20211228_102256.jpg" alt="" width="1078" height="657" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>


							<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Tramp info</h3>
												
							<p>From the carpark to the Bushline Hut it's about 3.5km, but it takes 2.5h since there is a bit of going up.  The track from the Bushline Hut to the Angelus Hut via the Robert Ridge is over 10km, the last third of which is rocky and mildly exposed.  It took us 6.5h in a possibly most ideal (not too hot nor cold) weather.  The raise in elevation from the carpark to the Angelus hut is 833m.  And so, return in each case, from Angelus to the Bushline as well as from the Bushline hut to the carpark, is easier and took us a bit less time.</p>
